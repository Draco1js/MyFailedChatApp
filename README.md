# Shitty af Chat App
#### This chat app was made in 2 days and first as a html page with an express backend, but then I changed it to react so that I could have error handling but then I ran out of time before I could finish the challenge. <br><br>

```diff
- DISCLAIMER
+ This is not a finished or working build :rofl:
```

# How to use

1. Clone repository
2. Open your terminal in the folder
3. Use `cd Backend` to move to that folder
4. Run `yarn install` and `yarn start` to launch the backend server
5. Use `cd ..` and then `cd chat-app` to go to the react project folder
6. Run `yarn install` and `yarn start` to launch the react website in a new browser window
7. idk how tf it will work, the build is broken, but this was a challenge so `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`.

###### Ok baiiii.
